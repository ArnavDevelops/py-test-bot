# Python-Test-Bot
 Since I'm learning Python. This would be my first Discord bot I made with Python!

# To Do List:
- [ ] Make Event Handler, Command Handler
- [ ] Make Basic Commands like embed, ping, etc.
- [X] Use .env

# Note
- Discord takes about 1 hour to register a Command made using Python.
